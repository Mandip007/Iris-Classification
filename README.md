# Iris-Classification

The aim of this ML model is to classify iris flowers among three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) from measurements of sepals and petals' length and width. The iris data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.

Major Python libraries such as Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Sklearn are used.

After the model is trained and tested successfully, the Accuracy/Precision of the model came out to be 97 %.

The data is collected from jbrownlee's dataset repository.
